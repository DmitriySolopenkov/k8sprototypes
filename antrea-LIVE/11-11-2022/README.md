## notes from jiunjen:
```
We are developing native CNF/secondary network support in Antrea in collaboration with Intel, but it is in progress. The first PR for SR-IOV is here: https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/pull/2651
#2651 Antrea secondary network implementation for SRIOV
Implement secondary network for Antrea CNI configured pods using SRIOV interface. (CNF use case)
Native support means it does not require Multus, Whereabouts, etc.
```
