Welcome to ...

This is the weekly antrea live-stream where we dig through evolution of various
upstream k8s networking technologies, especially focused around:

- the CNI ecosystem
- the Antrea project
- OpenVSWitch
- Multi-OS Networking
- and more !

If you're interested in doing a show with us, reach out to jayunit100 or yashbhutwala on K8s slack (in the antrea or sig-network rooms)
or file an issue in this repo!
