# Operational Readiness Specification for windows

To specify your windows cluster's readiness to run workflows:

- define the spec.json (you can use the example here as a template).
- run the golang program in this repository.

For customization of your specification, see https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/2975.
