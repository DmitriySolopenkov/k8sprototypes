# Prototypical installation of Windows on TKG

This is not supported by VMWare at this time, but rather a place to iterate on upstream artifacts for windows support on Cluster API with the Cluster APIVSphere provider.  Some of the artifacts referenced may require having access to a VMWare provided K8s installation, but they can all be built from equivalent upstream components.
